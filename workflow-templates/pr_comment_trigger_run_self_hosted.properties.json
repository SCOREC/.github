    "description": "\n
Summary: In a PR, authorized users (search for 'cwsmith'), can create an issue comment that contains the text /runtests, the github action will be triggered on the self-hosted runner, and the result with a link posted as a follow-up issue comment.\n
There are two github actions yaml files you'll want to copy to the `.github/workflows` directory in the adaptiveController repo.  Only the first file will need significant modification.\n
As defined now, the tests can only be triggered manually (by writing the comment `/runtests` in a PR) by the set of users listed in simmetrix_enabled_pr_comment_trigger_self_hosted.yml on line 21 and 22.\n
There are significant security concerns running code from a public github repo on a local system (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).\n
The manual triggering and separation of the workflow across two scripts helps mitigate some of the concerns.\n

  - this builds and runs the tests via bash commands (line 31-62) and prepares a message with the result (line 99-110)\n
  - you can ignore line 64-97 - that is just another configuration we wanted to test\n
\n
- https://github.com/SCOREC/core/blob/master/.github/workflows/comment_on_pr.yml\n
  - this posts the message with the result to the PR that triggered the run\n
  - you should only have to change line 7 if you change the name in the other yaml file (line 1 of simmetrix_enabled_pr_comment_trigger_self_hosted.yml)\n
\n
Once you have these scripts setup I can enable adaptiveController's access to our runner.  Note, it only has eight processors and 8GB of memory.  If more memory or cores are needed we could request that.\n",
